# 🚗 ParkSense

**ParkSense** is a smart parking system designed to help drivers find available parking spots in real-time using IoT sensors, machine learning, and a user-friendly web/mobile interface. The system aims to reduce traffic congestion and save time by optimizing parking space utilization in urban areas.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB instance (local or Atlas)
- Python 3.x (for ML module)
- Sensor setup if testing with hardware

### Installation

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/parksense.git
   cd parksense
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies  
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies  
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables (e.g., `.env`)  
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=5000
   ```

5. Run the backend server  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Run the frontend  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. (Optional) Run the ML model module  
   ```bash
   python3 predict_parking.py
   ```
